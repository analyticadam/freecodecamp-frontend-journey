    <h1>Full Stack Web Development</h1>
    <p>Full stack web development involves building both the front-end (what users see and interact with) and the back-end (the server, database, and application logic) of a website or web app. It combines technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface with tools like Node.js, Express, and databases such as MongoDB or SQL for server-side functionality. Essentially, a full stack developer can create a complete, functional web application from start to finish.</p>

      <h2>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h2>
      <p>HTML is the foundation of all web pages, providing the structure and layout for content displayed in a browser. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links that form the backbone of a website.</p>

      <h2>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
      <p>CSS controls the visual design of a website, including colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. It allows developers to separate style from structure, making websites more consistent, attractive, and easier to maintain.</p>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <p>JavaScript brings websites to life by adding interactivity, animations, and dynamic content that respond to user actions. It runs directly in the browser and, with frameworks like Node.js, can also power back-end functionality for full stack applications.</p>
